This is a utility library for logging into Google using the same environment variables and token file as [Dailygraphics Next](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-next) and the [Interactive Template](https://github.com/nprapps/interactive-template). You can use this programmatically, in which case it provides an async `authenticate()` function that takes an optional list of additional OAuth scopes, or you can use it from the command line if it's installed globally.

It's mostly meant for use in writing one-off scripts at NPR, and doesn't make a lot of sense for anyone else.
